        TODO:
        1. Move creating databases for patient database and user database here (pre-startup)
        2. Add a user with admin/admin username/pass if it doesn't exist here (pre-startup)
        3. Remove base path
        4. Replace database_path to use config.application_path as the root folder
           (i.e. database_path = path.join(config.application_path, patient_data.db).
           Should probably also make it patient_database_path.
        5. Do similar for user database (make a user_database_path variable).
